"""Usage: {0} [OPTION]... [DIRECTORY]

given, information will be fetched from the last directory specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -f, --file-types=EXTENSIONS  a comma separated list of file extensions to
                                 include when computing statistics. The
                                 default extensions used are:
                                 {1}
  -H, --hard                   look harder for duplicates of rows and files
  -l, --list-file-types        list all the file extensions available in the
                                 current branch of the repository
  -T, --timeline               show commit timeline, including author names
      --tda367                 show statistics and information in a way that
                                 is formatted for the course TDA367/DIT211
                                 this is currently the same as -lTw, but
                                 will later include some additional searches
                                 for things such as documentation (RAD/SDD)
  -h, --help                   display this help and exit
      --version                output version information and exit

gitinspector will filter statistics to only include commits that modify,
add or remove one of the specified extensions, see -f or --file-types for
more information.

gitinspector requires that the git executable is available in your PATH.
